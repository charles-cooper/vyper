Deploying a Contract
********************

Once you are ready to deploy your contract to a public test net or the main net, you have several options:

* Take the bytecode generated by the vyper compiler and manually deploy it through mist or geth:

.. code-block:: bash

  vyper yourFileName.vy
  # returns bytecode

* Take the byte code and ABI and deploy it with your current browser on `myetherwallet's <https://www.myetherwallet.com/>`_ contract menu:

.. code-block:: bash

  vyper -f abi yourFileName.vy
  # returns ABI

* Use the development environment provided at https://try.vyperlang.org to compile and deploy your contract on your net of choice. try.vyperlang.org comes "batteries-included", with `Titanoboa <https://titanoboa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_ pre-installed, and browser signer integration as well.
